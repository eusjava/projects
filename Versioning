What is versioning in life and in programming?
The concept of versioning is having a different or a change copy of the same object. Object can be anything, a person, toothpaste, clothes etc
Versioning software like git is used to store changes to the same file without changing the name of the file. it is like having a child and storing his or her pictures every year to show how he or she has grown over the years.
As we live and collaborate with people we get to see a different version of them everyday. You can determine what version of me you might want to get by doing the things that prompt me to give you that version that you are looking for because there are many different version of me. I will always have the same name, face and hands - body paths but the version of my character or behavior you get depend on what you search for. 
The bible tells us that whatever you search you will find so when you are looking for a particular version of anything, you go searching for it and you will find it.
You have to learn how to search for what version you want or need. If you need the best version of me, search for it by doing the things that will help you get the best version of me. If you want the fine and the great version me, research how you can get the best version of me.
